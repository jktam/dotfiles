# macOS dotfiles
#### updated to Tahoe
#### Big credits to [crissNb](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/) for the karabiner, sketchybar, skhd, and yabai configs, and to [FelizKratz](hhttps://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/) for sketchybar itself(!). Most of my changes are just padding to fit my device (MacBook Air M1 on Tahoe) and colors.
